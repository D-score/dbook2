# D-score booklet II: Tuning instruments to unity

Children learn to walk, speak, and think at an astonishing pace. The D-score captures this process as a one-number summary. The D-score booklets explain why we need the D-score, how we construct it, and how we calculate it. Application of the D-score enables comparisons in child development across populations, groups and individuals.

We are preparing four D-score booklets under the following titles:
