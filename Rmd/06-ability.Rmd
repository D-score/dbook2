# Comparing ability {#ch:ability}

In this chapter the $D$-score distributions per GCDG cohort are displayed and
the impact of measurement error is compared between the cohorts. Additionally
the coverage of the developmental domains is displayed for $D$-score scale and
for a single $D$-score.

* D-score distribution by study (\@ref(sec:dscores))
* Impact of measurement error (\@ref(sec:sem))
* Domain coverage (\@ref(sec:domains))


## D-score distribution by study {#sec:dscores}

For each study that is included in the GCDG assembly, the $D$-score can be
obtained using the developed global model. In the graphs below, the $D$-score
distributions are displayed for each cohort separately. The blue lines in the
graphs are the (temporary) references, as explained in \@ref(sec:references).
By using the *next* button below the plot you can click through the cohorts.
Using the selection bar above the graph, you can select a specific cohort.

(ref:dscoredist) $D$-score distributions by study.


## Impact of measurement error {#sec:sem}

For each estimated $D$-score from the calibrated model, the precision of the
estimate can be determined. This precision can be expressed as the standard
error of measurement ($sem$). The standard error of measurement is inversely
related to the number of items. Thus, when more items are administered for a
person, the measurement error for the $D$-score of this person will be smaller.
As is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:semforn), the sem drops fast when the number of
items is increased to 15, and still some more until the number of items is 30.
More than 30 items has little effect on the sem.


```{r semforn, results = 'hide', fig.keep = 'all', warning = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:semforn)', message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = dmetric::model_lean$dscore )+
  geom_smooth(aes(x=n, y=sem), se = FALSE, color = "red")+
  xlab("number of items")
```
(ref:semforn) Standard error of measurement when the number of items increases.


The precision of the $D$-score estimate is also affected by the information in
the items that are administered. This is partly the number of items, as depicted
in \@ref(fig:semforn), but also if the items are informative for the $D$-score.
For example, if the items are too easy and the probability to pass the item
given the $D$-score is $P$ > 0.90, the $sem$ is larger than when the difficulty
of the administered items is closer to the $D$-score (i.e. $P$ = 0.50). The
$sem$ for age in GCDG data (see Figure \@ref(fig:semfora)) shows that for some
ages, the $sem$ is larger than for others. This is on the one hand due to the
number of items available in that age range, but also to the design of the
cohorts where sometimes relatively easy items are administered.

(ref:semfora) Standard error of measurement in each age group.

In Figure \@ref(fig:dscoresems), the $sem$ per age group is shown for each
cohort separately. This illustrates the differences in design between the
cohorts. For example, the Netherlands 1 cohort (GCDG-NLD-SMOCC), the `ddi` was
used as a screener and items had the probability to pass of approximately
$P$=0.80 (quartile range between 0.62 < $P$ > 1.00), and the number of items
administered per measurement is about 10 items (quartile range 6 to 12 items).
The Colombia 1 cohort (GCDG-COL-LT45M) was an impact evaluation and has
administered the `by3` where each child answered on average 45 items (quartile
range 38 to 57 items) and the probability to pass was approximately $P$ = 0.64
(quartile range between 0.53 < $P$ > 0.79). The latter study has therefore more
precise $D$-score estimates.

```{r dscoresems}
#n items per child Netherlands 1 cohort = 8.5
#ids <- gcdg_lean$visit$subjid[which(gcdg_lean$visit$cohort=="GCDG-NLD-SMOCC")]
#itm <- gcdg_lean$itm[which(gcdg_lean$itm$subjid %in% ids),]
#itmn <- itm %>% group_by(subjid, agedays) %>% summarize(n=n())
#summary(itmn)
#p per child on average for Netherlands 1 cohort = 0.8 (median)
#summary(model_lean$dscore$p[which(model_lean$dscore$cohort == "GCDG-NLD-SMOCC")])

#n items per child Colombia cohort = 46
#ids <- gcdg_lean$visit$subjid[which(gcdg_lean$visit$cohort=="GCDG-COL-LT45M")]

(ref:dscoresems) Standard Error of Measurement for age by cohort

The $sem$ for an entire cohort or sample can be obtained by pooling the
individual $sem_i$ using general rule for pooling variances. Accordingly, the
$sem$ for a sample is obtained by combining the within variance
$\sum{sem_{i}^2}$ and the between variance $\sigma_d$ as in equation
\@ref(eq:poolsem)

\begin{equation}
sem = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{sem_{i}^2} + \sigma_d }{N-1}} (\#eq:poolsem)
\end{equation}

In Figure \@ref(fig:cohortsem) the sample $sem$ per cohort is displayed. The
lowest sample $sem$ is found in the Ethiopia study (GCDG-ETH) and the highest in
the South Africa cohort (GCDG-ZAF). This can be explained on the one hand by the
number of items per child, and on the other hand the difficulty of the
administered items.

(ref:cohortsem) Standard Error of Measurement per cohort.


Table \@ref(tab:npsem) shows the quartile ranges for the
number of items per child (n) and the probability to pass the items (p). In The
Ethiopia cohort 39 items (Q2; median) were administered with a median
probability of 0.66 and in the South Africa study just 12 items with a median
probability of 1. Accordingly, in the Ethiopia study more items were
administered per child that also have a high level of information for the
$D$-scores. In the South Africa study only few items were administered per child
that were also relatively easy and therefore contained less information for the
$D$-scores.

## Domain coverage {#sec:domains}
 
The $D$-score is a one number score that measures early child development. To
evaluate the content validity of the $D$-score we can make sure that all
developmental domains are fairly represented. We distinguish five domains for
child development: Fine Motor, Gross Motor, Expressive, Receptive, Cognitive. 

### Domain coverage of the scale

The items in the $D$-score model can be linked to one or more domains and the
cumulative item information to the $D$-score for each domain can be evaluated.
In Figure \@ref(fig:domaincov), the coverage of the domains for the $D$-score is
displayed. This shows that at lower levels of the $D$-score, motor development
is more dominant and that at higher levels of the $D$-score the cognitive van
language domains increase in importance.

```
(ref:domaincov) Domain coverage of the $D$-score scale.



### Domain coverage of a single $D$-score

The domain information for an individual $D$-score can also be calculated. To do
that we need the following information:

* what items were administered to measure the $D$-score
* to which domains are the items linked 
* what part of the information provides each item to the calculated $D$-score.


In Table \@ref(tab:example_part1) the item scores for a 1,5 year old child from the China cohort is displayed. This child has a $D$-score of 57.12. For each item, experts have indicated
to what domain(s) the item is linked. Items can link to multiple domains and
based on expert voting, we have a proportional loading for each item to a
domain.


```{r example_part1}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(dscore)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
#select a person from the data
#subject <- unique(dmetric::gcdg_lean$itm$subjid) [sample(25410, 1)]
subject <- 4100485

itembank <- builtin_itembank[builtin_itembank$key == "gsed",]

ex1_resp <- gcdg_lean$itm[gcdg_lean$itm$subjid == subject, c("item", "value")] %>% left_join(itembank, by = "item") %>% select(item, label, value, tau) %>% drop_na(tau) %>%   left_join(dmodel::get_domaintable("gcdg"), by = "item") %>% select(item, label, value, Fine.Motor, Gross.Motor, Expressive, Receptive, Cognitive, Adaptive)

ex1_resp[,c("Fine.Motor", "Gross.Motor", "Expressive", "Receptive", "Cognitive", "Adaptive")] <- round(ex1_resp[,c("Fine.Motor", "Gross.Motor", "Expressive", "Receptive", "Cognitive", "Adaptive")],2)

options(knitr.table.format = "html") 
kable(ex1_resp, 
      caption = "Responses for example child",
      row.names = FALSE, 
      col.names = c("Item", "Label", "Score", "Fine Motor", "Gross Motor", "Expressive", "Receptive", "Cognitive", "Adaptive")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
```
&nbsp;

For each item we can calculate the relative information that it contributes to the $D$-score of 57.12. In the paragraph [Item information in dbook I](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1/sec-iteminformation.html) we described
how to calculate the item information for a $D$-score We can combine the
proportional domain loading to the relative information that the item provides
to the $D$-score of the child. In Figure \@ref(fig:example_part2) this is
displayed. For example the item *Attends to story* contributes to 13% of the
$D$-score and the item is rates as partly Receptive, partly Cognitive and partly
Adaptive.

The relative information that each item holds per domain can be summed. That way
we get what domain information is composed in the $D$-score for this child.
Figure \@ref(fig:example_part3) displays the domain formation for the $D$-score
of the example. About 50% of the information was Cognitive, about 40% was Fine
motor and additionally partly adaptive and partly receptive information was
used.

<!-- 
Reconsider if we want to add this here. The residual plots do not give us a lot of information and I think they are strongly related to the number of items that are asked per domain. So more related to the number of items in de domain-score vs d-score than the score accuracy itself....

## Domain scores

It is possible to calculate a $D$-score that is more representative for a
specific domain using the current $D$-score model. We can use only the items
that load to the domain in question to calculate the $D$-score.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#calculate dscore per domain by using only items that are loading on the domain - items can load on multiple domains
#use vote_weight to indicate the minimum percentage of votes for the domain (ex. 0.5 at least half of the votes must be on the domain for that item to load on that domain)

## when the vote-weight is set at 0.5 > so minimal half of the raters must agree on the domain for an item for the item to count for that domain - then there are very little items in some of the domains. This causes deviations in D-score due to the small number of items for the D-score calculations (not because of domain info). This is not what we want to measure. So now try when there is at least one vote for the domain. Then items can count for multiple domains, but that not necessarily a problem. 

#example for one person
# i <- 25
# example1d <- gcdg_all[i,] %>%
#   pivot_longer(cols= c(d, d_motor, d_cog, d_lang, d_sem, d_life), names_to = "domain", values_to = "dscore")%>%
#   select(a, domain, dscore)
