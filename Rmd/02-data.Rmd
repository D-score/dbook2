##Overview of cohorts and instruments
Data from 16 cohorts were assembled by the Global Child Development Group (GCDG)
in order to develop a population-based measure to monitor early child
development across ages and countries. This resulted in a dataframe, with
development data from over 16,000 children from 11 countries. The countries that
are included in the study are colored blue on the word map below
\@ref(fig:worldmap).

The cohorts included birth cohorts, impact evaluation studies and instrument
evaluation studies. Children were assessed between 0 and 58 months and
followed-up between 4 and 18 years. In Table \@ref(tab:cohorts) a brief overview
of the instruments assessed per cohort is displayed. Below each cohort is
briefly described.

## Instruments

The **Bayley Scale for Infant and Todler Development (Bayley)** is aimed to
assess infants and toddlers, aged 1-42 months. The current version is the
Bayley-III, but in GCDG cohorts earlier version were also used (i.e. Bayley-I
and Bayley-II) [@bayley1969][@bayley1993][@bayley2006]. The 326 items of the
Bayley-III are distributed into three domains: Cognitive items, Motor items
(with fine and gross motor items) and Language items (with expressive and
receptive items). The Bayley-II contains 277 items and has two additional
subscales: Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior. Bayley-I contains 229 items.

The **Denver Developmental Screening Test (Denver)** is aimed to identify
developmental problems in children up to age six. The 125 dichotomous test items
are distributed over the age range from birth to six years.The Denver covers
four domains: personal-social, fine motor and adaptive, language and gross
motor. The test items are all directly observed by an examiner and are not
dependent on parent report [@frankenburg1992] [@frankenburg1990].

The **Griffiths Mental Development Scales (Griffiths)** measure the rate of
development in infants and young children in six developmenal areas: locomotor,
personal-social, hearing and language, eye and hand coordination, performance
and practical reasoning [@griffiths1967].
<!-- Griffiths R. The Abilities of Babies: A Study in Mental Measurement. University of London Press, 1967. -->

The **Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI)** measures key developmental skills
in children brom birth to 7 years, 11 months. The instrument contains 450 items
distributed over five domains: adaptive, personal-social, communication, motor,
and cognitive [@newborg2005].
<!-- Newborg J. Battelle Developmental Inventory-2nd Edition. Rolling Meadows, IL: Riverside Publishing, 2005. -->

The **Vineland Social Maturity Scale (Vineland)** is a test to assess social
competence. The instrument contains 8 subscales that measure communication
skills, general self-help ability, locomotion skills, occupation skills,
self-direction, self-help eating, self-help dressing and socialization skills
[@doll1953].
<!-- Doll EA. The measurement of social competence: A manual for the Vineland Social Maturity Scale. 1953. -->

The **Dutch Developmental Instrument (DDI)** measures early child development
during the ages 0-4 years. The instrument consists of 75 milestone items that
are distributed over three domains: fine motor, adaptive, personal and social
behavior; communication; and gross motor [@schlesinger1981].
<!-- Schlesinger-Was EA. Ontwikkelingsonderzoek van zuigelingen en kleuters op het consultatiebureau. 1981 -->

The **Barrera Moncada (Barrera)** is a Spanish instrument that measures the
growth and psychological develepment of children [@barrera1981].

The **Test de Desarrollo Psicomotor (Tepsi)** is an instrument to evaluate
toddlers aged 2 to 5 years on their development. The items are distributed over
three sub-tests: 16 items assess coordination; 24 items assess language skills
and 12 items assess motor skills [@haeussler1999].
<!-- Haeussler IM, Marchant T. Tepsi: test de desarrollo psicomotor 2-5 años. Eds. Universidad Católica de Chile, 1999 -->

The **Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ)** measures developmental progress in
children between 2 months and 5,5 years. The instrument assess development in
five areas: personal social, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and
communication. The ASQ contains sets of 30 items in 21 age intervals and is
completed by the caregiver [@squires2009].

The **Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales (SB)** is a cognitive ability and
intelligence test to diagnose developmental deficiencies in young children. The
items are distributed over five subtests: fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantative
reasoning, visual-spatial processing and working memory [@roid2003][@hagen1986].
