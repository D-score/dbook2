# Data {#ch:data}

In this booklet we explain the methodology that we used to obtain one score for Development ($D$-score) that is globally interprettable. This chapter introduces the data that we use to illustrate our methodology. The data originates from a study by the Global Child Development Group (GCDG) gathering child development data from 16 cohorts.

## Overview of cohorts and instruments {#sec:gcdgoverview}

The Global Child Development Group (GCDG) collected data from 16
cohorts. The objective of the study was to develop a population-based
measure to monitor early child development across ages and countries.
The requirements for inclusion were

1. direct assessment of child development;
2. availability of individual milestone scores;
3. spanning ages between 0-5 years; 
4. availability of follow-up measures, at ages 5-10 years.

The effort resulted in a database containing individual data from over 16,000
children from 11 countries. The world map below (Figure: \@ref(fig:worldmap))
colors the countries included in the study. Section \@ref(sec:cohorts) briefly
describes each cohort. Section \@ref(sec:instruments) reviews the measurement
instruments.


```{r worldmap, fig.cap='(ref:worldmap)', fig.keep='all', results='hide', fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=8}

## Cohort descriptions {#sec:cohorts}

<!-- NOTE: Monotonous and repetitive reading. This information is
probably better presented as a table. The more journalistic
alternative would be to highlight the motivation of each study, and
contrast sources and approaches which each other. -->

The cohorts have different designs, age ranges and assessment instruments. In Figure \@ref(fig:design) for each cohort the age range for the development assessments is displayed colored by the developmental instruments that were used. Below the Figure a brief description of each cohort is written. 


```{r design, fig.width=10, fig.keep='all', results='hide', fig.cap = '(ref:design)' }

## Instruments {#sec:instruments}

<!-- NOTE: Monotonous and repetitive reading. This information is
probably better presented as a table. Perhaps cluster the instruments
by types (e.g. individual vs screener, one scale vs multiple scales,
binary vs polytomous vs mixed)? Perhaps a simple HOMALS analysis that
displays the most salient features? -->

The **Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development (`by1`,`by2`,
`by3`)** aim to assess infants and toddlers, aged 1-42 months. The
current version is the `by3`, but in GCDG cohorts earlier version were
also used (i.e. `by1` and `by2`)
[@bayley1969][@bayley1993][@bayley2006]. The 326 items of the `by3`
measure three domains: Cognitive items, Motor items (with fine and
gross motor items) and Language items (with expressive and receptive
items). The `by2` contains 277 items and has two additional subscales:
Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior. by1 contains 229 items.

The **Denver Developmental Screening Test (`den`)** is aimed to
identify developmental problems in children up to age six. The 125
dichotomous test items are distributed over the age range from birth
to six years. The Denver covers four domains: personal-social, fine
motor and adaptive, language, and gross motor. The test items are all
directly observed by an examiner and are not dependent on parent
report [@frankenburg1992] [@frankenburg1990].

The **Griffiths Mental Development Scales (`gri`)** measure the rate
of development in infants and young children in six developmental
areas: loco motor, personal-social, hearing and language, eye and hand
coordination, performance and practical reasoning [@griffiths1967].
<!-- Griffiths R. The Abilities of Babies: A Study in Mental
Measurement. University of London Press, 1967. -->

The **Battelle Developmental Inventory (`bat`)** measures key
developmental skills in children from birth to 7 years, 11 months. The
instrument contains 450 items distributed over five domains: adaptive,
personal-social, communication, motor, and cognitive [@newborg2005].
<!-- Newborg J. Battelle Developmental Inventory-2nd Edition. Rolling
Meadows, IL: Riverside Publishing, 2005. -->

The **Vineland Social Maturity Scale (`vin`)** is a test to assess
social competence. The instrument contains eight subscales that
measure communication skills, general self-help ability, locomotion
skills, occupation skills, self-direction, self-help eating, self-help
dressing and socialization skills [@doll1953].
<!-- Doll EA. The measurement of social competence: A manual for the

The **Dutch Developmental Instrument (`ddi`)** measures early child
development during the ages 0-4 years. The instrument consists of 75
milestone items that are distributed over three domains: fine motor,
adaptive, personal and social behavior; communication; and gross motor
[@schlesinger1981].

The **Barrera Moncada (`bar`)** is a Spanish instrument that measures
the growth and psychological development of children [@barrera1981].

The **Test de Desarrollo Psicomotor (`tep`)** is an instrument to
evaluate toddlers aged 2 to 5 years on their development. The items
are distributed over three sub-tests: 16 items assess coordination; 24
items assess language skills and 12 items assess motor skills
[@haeussler1999].

The **Ages and Stages Questionnaire (`asq`)** measures developmental
progress in children between 2 months and 5,5 years. The instrument
assess development in five areas: personal social, gross motor, fine
motor, problem solving and communication. The `asq` contains sets of
30 items in 21 age intervals and is completed by the caregiver
[@squires2009].

The **Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales (`sbi`)** is a cognitive
ability and intelligence test to diagnose developmental deficiencies
in young children. The items are distributed over five subtests: fluid
reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing
and working memory [@roid2003][@hagen1986].
