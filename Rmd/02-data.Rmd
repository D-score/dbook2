## Global Child Development Group
The aim of the Global Child Development Groups is to develop a population-based
measure to monitor early child development across ages and countries. In order
to do this, the group assembled data from 16 cohorts, with data from over 16,000
children from 11 countries.

## Cohort descriptions

The cohorts included bith cohorts, impact evaluation studies and instrument
evaluation studies. Children were assessed between 0 and 58 months and
followed-up between 4 and 18 years. In Table \@ref(tab:cohorts) a brief overview
of the instruments assessed per cohort is displayed. Below each cohort is
briefly described.

###Bayley Scale for Infant and Todler Development (Bayley)

The Bayley is aimed to assess infants and totddles, aged 1-42 months. The current version is the Bayley-III, but in GCDG cohorts earlier version are also used (i.e. Bayley-I and Bayley-II). The 326 items of the Bayley-III are distributed into three domains: Cognitive item, Motor items (with fine and gross motor items) and Language items (with expressive and receptive items).
