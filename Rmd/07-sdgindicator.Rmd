# SDG 4.2.1 Indicator {#ch:SDGindicator}

## Application I: Estimating the SDG 4.2.1 indicator from existing data

Sustainable Development Goal number 4 is to ensure inclusive an equitable
quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Target
4.2 holds that by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality
early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are
ready for primary eductation. Indicator 4.2.1 is to measure the proportion of
children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track in health,
learning and psychosoical well-beying, by sex.

The $D$-score can be obtained from any instrument that is included in the
calibrations for the score. This makes the $D$-score suited as a global score
for development. Accordingly, the $D$-score can be used for the SDG 4.2.1
indicator and interpreted as the global measure for development.

In the cohorts that are currently included in the GCDG study, a wide range of
countries are represented \@ref(sec:gcdgoverview). Combining existing data from
such a wide range of countries to create the $D$-score, broadens the
interpretation of the $D$-score. Nevertheless, for obtaining accurate references
that represent world-wide population, more representative (existing) data needs
to be added.

## Definition *developmentally on track*

For child growth, (global) standards are published by the World Health
Orgnaization (WHO) that are used to monitor growth in childen and to define
whether children are *on track*. Growth standards are defined for
weight-for-age, length/height-for age, weight-for-length/height, etc. In 2006,
the methods for constructing a growth reference were reviewed by statisticians
and growth experts that resulted in an advised strategy for constructing growth
standard [@borghi2006]. A similar strategy can be used to construct a reference
standard child develpment-for-age. This reference standard can then be used to
determine whether children are *developmentally on track*.

In Figure \@ref(fit:dscorerefs), the strategy for constructing standards for
development and to use them to define on track dvelopment is explained in
several steps. In the first step the D-score is plotted by age and in the
subsequent steps, this relation is modelled in an an LMS model. The goal of an
LMS model is to describe the relation of the $D$-score by age with
age-conditional z-scores. This is done by three smoothed curves representing the
median, coefficient of variation and the skewness. The resulting age
standardized scores for development (daz), are then used to define on-track
development. So D-scores within 2 standard deviations from the mean can be
defines as on-track. Scores that are outside this range, are off-track.

Note that the current reference is based on the GCDG study. The cohorts that are
currently included are representing a wide range of countries. However, they are
not representative for a global population. The current reference standards are
therefore temporary and should be improved when more data are available.


## Country-level estimates

For each age-$D$-score combination, a daz can be calculated. That way we can
calculate the daz in each country that is included in the current GCDG study. By
using the -2SD rule, we can obtain the percentage on-track development in each
country.

```{r}
model_lean$dscore %>%
  mutate(track = ifelse(daz < -2, 0, 1),
         country =  substr(cohort, 6, 8) ) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize("on-track"= sum(track, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(!is.na(track)))
```
