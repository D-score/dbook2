# Comparability {#ch:comparability}

## Challenge of comparability

The ultimate goal of having a global score for development is to compare
children from different populations. In order to do this, the data included in
the GCDG study had to be harmonized. [add info on harmonization]


In order to evaluate and analyse the data from the different cohorts as one
large dataset, the cohorts need to be connected. On the one hand this can be
done by using the overlapping instruments from the different cohorts as
connections. In Table the connections between the cohorts via overlapping
instruments are displayed. In the tabpanels the linkages are displayed by 6
month age block. As can be observed, some cohorts (and instruments) are not yet
linked. For these cohorts and intruments, bridging can be accomplished by
mapping items.

  height = "600px")
```


## Bridging instruments by mapping items 

Items from different instruments can be mapped to each other by similarity. In
the GCDG study the mapping was done using the Bayley-III items as reference
point. The Bayley-III was the most frequently administered instrument in te
cohorts, so the items from other instruments were mapped to the Bayley-III items
based on similar wordings and descriptions in reference manuals by experienced
subject matter experts. Additionally, same-skill items across other instruments
were mapped into groups, if they did not map onto Bayley-III items. This
resulted in 95 groups of mapped items.
