# Equate groups {#ch:equategroups}

## Definition of equate groups

A group of items that measure the same thing in (perhaps slightly) different
ways is called an “equate group”. An equate group can link items across
instruments by restricting their difficulty estimates to be identical. Equate
groups provide an extra option for linking different instruments to the same
scale. Figure \@ref(fig:equateex) displays the items from three different
instruments that measure child development. The instruments contain some common
items that are measured in multiple instuments, but also unique items. The
common items can be linked in an equate group as displayed by the arrows between
them. In the example there is one (common) item that is equivalent in all three
instruments (i.e. walk alone). The item "sitting" occurs in both the first (i.e.
blue) and the second (i.e. green) instrument and the item "clabs hand together"
occurs in the second (i.e. green) and third (i.e. orange instrument).

When each instrument is administered in a different cohort, the cohorts can be
linked by placing the common items in the same column. The common items will
have the same difficulty estimates due to linkin with "concurrent calibration".
However, when the first and second instruments are both administered in the same
cohort and the third in a second, concurrent calibration is not possible for
common items in the first two instruments. In that situation, the equate group
method provides a more flexible way to link items with similar assumptions as in
the concurrent calibration method.


## Requirements of equate groups

Statistical information and content experts form the basis of the assignment of
items to eligible equate groups. This is done by mapping similar items
[reference to mapping in prev ch]. In actual modeling, there are “active” equate
groups (equate groups for which indeed the restriction is applied) and “passive”
equate groups (similar items for which the restriction is not applied). Only
active groups bridge different instruments in the final model.

The following strategies are recommended to be applied to select equate groups:

* Mixed method collaborations including both statistical and content experts can
ensure the identification of similarities and differences in item formulations
from different instruments, effectively mapping like-skill items across
instruments, and forming the basis of the assignment of items to equate groups.
* The quality of the item mapping can be tested with methods designed to detect
differential item functioning. For the final model, a selection from the
eligible equate groups can be made that links all cohorts and instruments. 
* Distributing equate groups over the scale, rather than centered at one point
enhances the functioning of the equate groups. Note that infit and outfit can be
calculated for equate groups, which provides a natural measure of equate group
quality. 
* It is preferable to use equate groups when the cohort abilities
differ, since the method is robust against a mis-specification up to 1.7 logits.
However, when cohort abilities are relatively uniform and the risk of
mis-specification of the equate groups is high, a model without equate group
would be preferred.

## Statistical framework 

The Rasch model, models the probability of passing an item as a logistic
function of the difference between each person’s ability and the difficulty of
the item as follows: $$P_{ni} = \frac{exp(\beta_n - \delta_i)}{1+exp(\beta_n -
\delta_i)}$$, where $P_{ni}$ is the probability of passing item $i$, $δ_i$ is
the item calibration dependent on the attributes of item $i$, i.e. the
difficulty of item $i$ and $\beta_n$ depends on the attribute of person n, i.e.
the ability of the person (Wright and Stone 1999). The log odds that a person
with ability $\beta_n$ answers an item with difficulty $\delta_i$ correctly is
the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty
$(\beta_n-\delta_i)$. In order to facilitate the use of equate groups to link
similar items used in different instruments and cohorts, the Rasch model can be
extended. This extension holds a restriction where item difficulties of similar
items are constrained to be equal. Wright and Stone (1999) present a simple
method to equate the difficulty between two test forms that have common item
links. This is done by estimating the shift in difficulty as the weighted
average of difficulty differences of the linking items, and using this weighted
average to align the difficulties of the test forms. This is comparable to the
transformation methods described previously. We can use this way of aligning
forms, to align item difficulties of items in an equate group: $$\delta_q =
\frac{\sum_{l}^{i} \delta_iw_i}{\sum_{l}^{l} w_i}$$, where $\delta_q$ is the
combined difficulty of the items in the equate group, $\delta_i$ is the
difficulty of each item in the equate group and $l$ is the number of items in
the equate group and $w_i$ is the number of respondents that have an observed
score on item $i$.


## Common latent scale

Items from different instruments can be but on one common latent scale by
linking items with the equate group method. Linking the items is a vital step,
when different instrumentst are assessed in different samples of persons (i.e.
cohorts). Because by nature, the scales are then unconnected, thus there is no
overlap between either the insturment or the cohorts.

To illustrate the methodology, we use three example studies from the GCDG
project: the Netherlands 1 study, the Ethiopia study and the Colombia 2 study. A
full description of these studies are presented in Chapter 2 [ref ch2data]. Not
all children in a cohort were administered all items from their respective
instruments and some children were assessed in repeated waves over time. To
obtain a measurement model on the combined data for the three studies, the Rasch
model with equate groups was fitted. Badly fitting items were removed based on
item infit and outfit (z-score > 0), until the model contained only items with
good fit. In addition, the fit of active equate groups was assessed. Eight
candidate equate groups were carefully selected based on expert judgement as
part of the GCDG project. In total the fitted model contained 185 remaining
items: 31 ASQ items, 84 Bayley-III items, 53 DDI items, and 17 Denver items,
connected by 8 equates. Table 3 provides an overview of items per study and the
connecting equate groups. Rasch models with and without equate groups were
fitted with the 185 items.

## Quantifying equate fit

## Differential item functioning

An important assumption underlying equate groups is that the items in the group
work in the same way across the different cohorts, i.e., there is no
differential item functioning. This assumption is critical for active equate
groups. If it is not met, restricting the difficulty parameters to be equal
across cohorts may introduce unwanted bias in comparisons between cohorts.
