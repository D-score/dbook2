## Previous work on the D-score {#sec:previous}

The D-score booklet I [Turning milestones into measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1) highlights the concepts and tools needed to obtain a quantitative score from a set of developmental milestones.

In practice, we typically want to make the following types of comparisons:

- Compare development within the same child over time;
- Compare the development of two children of the same age;
- Compare the development of two children of different ages;
- Compare the development of groups of children of different ages.

To do this well, we need an *interval scale with a fixed unit of development*. We argued that the simple Rasch model is a very suitable candidate to provide us with such a unit. The Rasch model is simple, fast, and we found that it fitted child developmental data very well [@jacobusse2006][@vanbuuren2014]. The Rasch model has a long history, but -unfortunately- it is almost unknown outside the field of psychometrics. We highlighted the concepts of the model that are of direct relevance to child development. Using data collected by the Dutch Development Instrument, we demonstrated that the model and its estimates behave as intended for children in the open population, for prematurely born-children, and children living in a low- and middle-income country.

As our approach breaks with the traditional paradigm that emphasises different domains of child development, we expected a slow uphill battle for acceptance. We have now gained the interest from various prominent authors in the field, and from organisations who recognise the value of a one-number-summary for child development. In analogy to traditional growth charts, it is entirely possible to track children, or groups of children, on a developmental chart over time. Those and other applications of the technology may eventually win over some more souls.

## What this volume is about {#sec:thisvolume}

It is straightforward to apply the D-score methodology as explained in [Turning milestones into measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1) for measurements observed by one instrument. In practice, however, there is a complication. We often need to deal with multiple, partially overlapping tools. For example, our data may contain

- different versions of the same instrument (e.g., Bayley I, II and III);
- different language versions of the same tool;
- different tools administered to the same sample;
- different tools administered to different samples;
- and so on.

Since there are over 150 different instruments to measure child development [@fernald2017toolkit], the chances are high that our data also hold data observed by multiple tools.

It is not apparent how to obtain comparable scores from different instruments. Tools may have idiosyncratic instructions to calculate total scores, distinctive domain definitions, unique compositions of norm groups, different floors and ceilings, or combinations of these.

This booklet addresses the problem *how to define and calculate the D-score based on data coming from multiple sources, using various instruments administered at varying ages*. We explain techniques that systematically exploit the overlap between tools to create comparable scores. For example, many instruments have variations on milestones like *Can stack two blocks*, *Can stand* or *Says baba*. By carefully mapping out the similarities between instruments, we can construct a constrained measurement model informed by subject matter knowledge. As a result, we can map different instruments onto the same scale.

Many of the techniques are well known within psychometrics and educational research. This booklet translates the concepts to the field of child development.

## Relevance of the work {#sec:relevance}

We all like our children to grow and prosper. The *first 1000 days* refers to the time needed for a child to grow from conception to its second birthday. During this period, the architecture of the developing brain is very open to the influence of relationships and experiences. It is a time of rapid change that lays the groundwork for later health and happiness. 

Professionals and parents consider it necessary to monitor children’s development. While we can track the child’s physical growth by growth charts to identify children with signs of potential delay, there are no charts for monitoring child development. To create such charts, we need to have a unit of development, similar to units like centimetres or kilograms. 

The D-score is a way to define a unit of child development. With the D-score, we see that progress is much faster during infancy, and that different children develop at different rates. The D-score also allow us to define a “normal” range that we can use to filter out those who are following a more pathological course. There is good evidence that early identification and early intervention improve the outcomes of children [@britto2017]. Early intervention is crucial for children with developmental disabilities because barriers to healthy development early in life impede progress at each subsequent stage.

Monitoring child development provides caregivers and parents with reliable information about the child and an opportunity to intervene at an early age. Understanding the developmental health of populations of children allows organisations and policymakers to make informed decisions about programmes that support children’s greatest needs [@bellman2013].

## Why this booklet? {#sec:why}

We believe that *there cannot be one instrument* for measuring child development that is suitable for all situations. In general, the tool needs tailoring to the setting. We also believe that *there can be one scale* for measuring child development and that this scale is useful for many applications. 

We see that practitioners often view instruments and scales as exchangeable. In daily practice the practitioner would pick a particular tool to measure a specific faculty, which then effectively produces a "scale score". Each tool produces its own score, which then feeds into the diagnostic and monitoring process.

We have always found it difficult to explain to scales and instruments are different things. For us, a scale is a continuous concept, like "distance", "temperature" or "child development", and the instrument is the way to assign values to the particular object being measured. For measuring distance, we use devices like rods, tapes, sonar, radar, geo-location, or red-shift detection, and we can express the results as the location under the underlying scale (e.g., as number of meters). It would undoubtedly be an advance if we could establish a *unit of child development*, and express the measurement as the number of units. If we succeed, we can compare child development measured through different devices. This booklet explores the theory and practice for making that happen.

## Intended audience {#sec:audience}

We aim for three broad audiences:

- Professionals in the field of child growth and development;
- Policymakers in international settings;
- Statisticians, methodologists, and data scientists.

Professionals in child development are constantly faced with the problem that different instruments for measuring child development yield incomparable scores. This booklet introduces and illustrates sound psychometric techniques *for extracting comparable scores from existing instruments*. We hope this our approach will ease communication between professionals.

Policymakers in international settings are looking for simple, versatile and cheap instruments to gain insight into the effect of interventions. The ability to measure child development by a single number *enhances priority setting and leads to a more accurate understanding of policy effects*.

The text may appeal to statisticians and data scientists for *the simplicity of the concepts, for the (somewhat unusual) application of statistical models to discard data, for the ease of interpretation of the result, and for the availability of software*.
