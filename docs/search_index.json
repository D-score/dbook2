Once we have such a score, we may Compare development within the same child over time; Compare development of two children of the same age; Compare development of two children at different ages; Compare developmemt of groups of children at different ages; And so on… In practice, the problem is more complicated. There are about 150 different instruments to measure child development. (Fernald et al. 2017) In principle, one could apply the methodology of booklet I to each instrument separately. Every instrument would thus define its own quantitative scale. The problem with this approach is that measurements made on those scales cannot be compared to each other. More in particular, scores will be specific to the milestones, study samples, and the domain coverage of the particular instrument. In sum, we wouldn’t be able to compare development across instruments, a major impediment. What is needed instead is either Everybody uses the same instrument; We extract comparable scores from different instruments. Option 1 seems easy, but may effectively halt the science of measuring child development. Until we have the perfect instrument option 2 is the only realistic choice. In this booklet we aim to exploit the overlap between instruments to create comparable scores. For example, most instruments have milestones like Can stack two blocks, Is able to stand or Says baba. By carefully mapping out the similarities between instruments we are able constrain the statistical model in a sensible way. As a result, we can map different instruments onto the same scale. This chapter introduces the data that we use to illustrate our methodology. The data originates from a study by the Global Child Development Group (GCDG) gathering child development data from 16 cohorts.

["section-sec-instruments.html", "2.3 Instruments", " 2.3 Instruments The Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development (by1,by2, by3) aim to assess infants and toddlers, aged 1-42 months. The current version is the by3, but in GCDG cohorts earlier version were also used (i.e. by1 and by2) (Bayley 1969)(Bayley 1993)(Bayley 2006). The 326 items of the by3 measure three domains: Cognitive items, Motor items (with fine and gross motor items) and Language items (with expressive and receptive items). The by2 contains 277 items and has two additional subscales: Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior. by1 contains 229 items. The Denver Developmental Screening Test (den) is aimed to identify developmental problems in children up to age six. The 125 dichotomous test items are distributed over the age range from birth to six years. The Denver covers four domains: personal-social, fine motor and adaptive, language, and gross motor. The test items are all directly observed by an examiner and are not dependent on parent report (Frankenburg et al. 1992) (Frankenburg et al. 1990). The Griffiths Mental Development Scales (gri) measure the rate of development in infants and young children in six developmenal areas: locomotor, personal-social, hearing and language, eye and hand coordination, performance and practical reasoning (Griffiths 1967). The Battelle Developmental Inventory (bat) measures key developmental skills in children from birth to 7 years, 11 months. The instrument contains 450 items distributed over five domains: adaptive, personal-social, communication, motor, and cognitive (Newborg 2005). The Vineland Social Maturity Scale (vin) is a test to assess social competence. The instrument contains eight subscales that measure communication skills, general self-help ability, locomotion skills, occupation skills, self-direction, self-help eating, self-help dressing and socialization skills (Doll 1953). The Dutch Developmental Instrument (ddi) measures early child development during the ages 0-4 years. The instrument consists of 75 milestone items that are distributed over three domains: fine motor, adaptive, personal and social behavior; communication; and gross motor (Schlesinger-Was 1981). The Barrera Moncada (bar) is a Spanish instrument that measures the growth and psychological development of children (Barrera Moncada 1981). The Test de Desarrollo Psicomotor (tep) is an instrument to evaluate toddlers aged 2 to 5 years on their development. The items are distributed over three sub-tests: 16 items assess coordination; 24 items assess language skills and 12 items assess motor skills (Haeussler and Marchant 1999). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (asq) measures developmental progress in children between 2 months and 5,5 years. The instrument assess development in five areas: personal social, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and communication. The asq contains sets of 30 items in 21 age intervals and is completed by the caregiver (Squires and Bricker 2009). The Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales (sbi) is a cognitive ability and intelligence test to diagnose developmental deficiencies in young children. The items are distributed over five subtests: fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantative reasoning, visual-spatial processing and working memory (Roid 2003)(Hagen and Stattler 1986). "],

["section-sec-challenge.html", "3.1 Are instruments connected?", " 3.1 Are instruments connected? The ultimate goal is to compare child development across populations and cultures. A complication is that measurements are made by different instruments. To do deal with this issue, we harmonise the data included in the GCDG cohorts. In particular, we process the milestone responses such that the following requirements hold: Every milestone in an instrument has a unique name and a descriptive label; Every milestone occupies one column in the dataset; Item scores are (re)coded as: 1 = PASS; 0 = FAIL; Items not administered or not answered are a missing value; Every row in the dataset corresponds to a unique cohort-child-age combination. Cohorts and milestones need to be connected. There are several ways to connect cohorts: Two cohorts are directly connected if they use the same instrument; Two cohorts are indirectly connected if both connect to a third cohort that connects them. Likewise, instruments can be connected: Two instruments are directly connected if the same cohort measures both; Two instruments are indirectly connected if both connect to a third instrument that connects them. Table 3.1: Linkage pattern indicating combinations of cohorts and instruments. aqi bar bat by1 by2 by3 ddi den gri mac peg sbi sgr tep vin Bangladesh X Brazil 1 X Brazil 2 X Chile 1 X Chile 2 X X China X Colombia 1 X Colombia 2 X X X X Ecuador X Ethiopia X Jamaica 1 X Jamaica 2 X Madagascar X X X Netherlds 1 X Netherlds 2 X S Africa X X X X An X in Table 3.1 identifies which cohorts use which instruments. The linkage table shows that studies from China, Colombia and Ethiopia are directly connected (by by3). Brazil 1 indirectly connects to these studies through den. Some cohorts (e.g., Chile 1 and Ecuador) do not link to any other study. Likewise, we might say that aqi, bat, by3 and den are directly connected. Note that no indirect connections exist to this instrument group. Table 3.1 is a somewhat simplified version of the linkage pattern. As we saw in section 2.2, there are substantial age differences between the cohorts. The table at https://tnochildhealthstatistics.shinyapps.io/GCDG_instrument_linkage/ shows the counts of the number of registered scores per age group. What appears in table 3.1 as one test may actually comprise of two disjoint subsets, and hence some cohorts may not be connected after all. Connectedness is a necessary - though not sufficient - requirement for parameter identification. If two cohorts are not connected, we cannot distinguish between the following two alternative explanations: Any differences between studies can be attributed to the ability of the children; Any differences between studies can be attributed to the difficulties of the instruments. The data do not contain the necessary information to discriminate between these two explanations. Since many cohorts in Table 3.1 are unconnected, it seems that we are stuck. The next section suggests a way out of the dilemma. "],
["section-sec-mapping.html", "3.2 Bridging instruments by mapping items", " 3.2 Bridging instruments by mapping items Many instruments for measuring child development have appeared since the works of Shirley (1933) and Gesell (1943). It is no surprise that their contents show substantial overlap. All tools assess events like starting to see, hear, smile, fetch, crawl, walk, speak and think. We will exploit the overlap to bridge different instruments. For example, Table 3.2 displays the labels of milestones from six instruments. All items probe the ability of the child to formulate “sentences” of two words. Table 3.2: Example of similar items from different instruments. Item Label by1mdd136 sentence of 2 words by2mdd114 Uses a two-word utterance ddicmm041 Says sentences with 2 words denlgd019 Combine Words grihsd217 Uses word combinations vinxxc016 use a short sentence The idea is to check whether these milestones measure development in the same way. If this is found to be accurate, then we may formally restrict the difficulty levels of these milestones to be identical. This restriction provides a formal bridge between the instruments. We repeat the process for all groups of similar-looking items. A first step in the bridging process is to group items from different instruments by similarity. As the by3 is relatively long and is the most often used instrument, it provides a convenient starting point. Subject matter experts experiences in child development mapped items from other tools to by3 items. These experts evaluated the similarity of wordings and descriptions in reference manuals. Also, they mapped same-skill items across other instruments into groups if these did not map onto by3 items. We order item mappings into five domains: fine motor (FM), gross motor (GM), cognitive (COG), receptive (REC) and expressive (EXP). Figure 3.1 displays the connections between the instruments (blue nodes) via the item groups in each domain. Figure 3.1: Connections between the instruments via mapped item groups. "],
["section-sec-viewmapping.html", "3.3 Age profile of item mappings", " 3.3 Age profile of item mappings One way to explore the similarity of milestones from different instruments is to plot the probability of passing by age. Figure 3.2 shows two examples. Figure 3.2: The probability of passing by age in potential bridging items. The first graph presents the age curves of a group of four cognitive items that assess the ability to put a cube or block in a cup or box. The milestones are administered in different studies and seem to work similarly. The second plot shows a similar graph for items that assess the ability to build a tower of six cubes or blocks. Also here the milestones have similar age patterns. Figure 3.3: Probability to pass items for age in poor bridges. Figure 3.3 presents two examples of weak item mappings. Notable timing differences exist for the “babbles” and “bangs” milestones, which suggests that we should not take these as bridges. While these plots are suggestive, their interpretation is surprisingly complicated. We may find that age profiles of two milestones A and B administered in samples 1 and 2 respectively are identical if A and B are equally difficult and samples 1 and 2 have the same maturation level; A is more difficult than B and sample 1 is more advanced than 2. Similarly, we may find that the age profile for A is earlier than B if A is easier than B and if samples 1 and 2 have the same level of maturation; A and B are equally difficult and if sample 1 is more advanced than sample 2. Note that the age curves confound difficulty and ability, and hence cannot be used to evaluate the quality of the item map. What we need to do is separate difficulty and ability. For this, we need a formal statistical model. The next chapter introduces the concepts required in such a model. "],

["section-sec-eqdef.html", "4.1 What is an equate group?", " 4.1 What is an equate group? An equate group is a set of two or more milestones that measure the same thing in (perhaps slightly) different ways. Table 3.2 contains an example of an equate group, containing items that measure the ability to form two-word sentences. Also, Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show examples of equate groups. Equate groups can be of different quality. We can use high-quality equate groups to link instruments by restricting the difficulty of all equate group members to be identical. Equate groups thus provide a method for bridging different tools. Figure 4.1: Example of three instruments that are bridged by common items in equate groups. Figure 4.1 displays items from three different instruments that measure child development. The instruments contain a few milestones shared by all tools. The shared items make up equate groups, as displayed by the arrows between them. In the example, all three instruments share one milestone (“walk alone”). The “sitting” and “clap hand” items appear in two tools. There are three equate groups. "],
["section-sec-concurrent.html", "4.2 Concurrent calibration", " 4.2 Concurrent calibration Patterns as in Figure 4.1 occur if we have multiple forms of the same instrument. Although in theory, there might be sequence effects, the consensus is that we may ignore form-effects. Equate groups with truly shared items are of high-quality. We may collect the responses on all items from a high-quality equate group into the same column of the data matrix. As a consequence, the shared item from different forms will automatically have one difficulty estimate. The procedure described above is known as concurrent calibration. See Kim and Cohen (1998) for background. The method simultaneously estimates the item parameters for all instruments. Concurrent calibration is an attractive option for various reasons: It yields a common latent scale across all instruments; It is efficient because it calibrate all items in a single run; It produces more stable estimates for shared items for small samples. However, concurrent calibration depends on a strict distinction between items that are indeed the same in different instruments and items that differ. In practice, strict black-white distinctions may not be possible. Items that measure the same skill may have been adapted to suit the format of the instrument (e.g. number of response options, question formulation, and so on). Also, investigators may have altered the item to suit the local language and cultural context. Such changes may or may not affect the measurement properties. In practice, we need to perform concurrent calibration to multiple - perhaps slightly dissimilar - milestones. When confronted with similar - but not identical - items, our strategy is first to form equate groups. We then explore and test the quality of each equate group, in the hope that we will find enough high-quality equate groups to bridge instruments. "],
["section-sec-equaterules.html", "4.3 Strategy to form and test equate groups", " 4.3 Strategy to form and test equate groups An equate group is a collection of items. As a part of concurrent calibration, we may specify that some equate groups are active. The analysis will treat items within such groups as one. Any remaining equate groups are called passive — the model views milestones within such groups as separate. Only active equate groups can bridge different instruments. In general, we will set the status of an equate group to active only if we believe that interchanging items within the group does not affect the result. Note that this does not necessarily imply that all items need to be identical. In Table 3.2, for example, small differences exist in item formulation. We may nevertheless believe that these are irrelevant and ignore these in practice. Reversely, there is no guarantee that the same milestone will measure child development in the same way in different samples. For example, a milestone like “climb stairs” could more difficult (and more dangerous) for children who have never seen a staircase. Decisions to activate equate groups should be informed by both subject matter expertise and by fit to the statistical model. The following steps implement our strategy for forming and enabling equate groups: Content matter experts compare milestones from different instruments and sort similar milestones into equate groups. It may be convenient to select one instrument as a starting point, and map items from others to that (see section 3.2); Visualise age profiles of mapped items (see section 3.3). Verify the plausibility of potential matches through similar age profiles. Break up mappings for which age profiles appear implausible. This step requires both statistical and subject matter expertise; Fit the model to the data using a subset of equate groups as active. Review the quality of the solution and optimise the quality of the links between tools by editing the equate group structure. The technical details of this model are explained in section 4.4. Refit the model until (1) active equate groups link all cohorts and instruments, (2) active equate groups distribute over the full-scale range (rather than being centred at one point); Assess the quality of equate groups by the infit and outfit (see section 4.6). Test performance of the equate groups across subgroups or cohorts by methods designed to detect differential item functioning (see section 4.7). The application of equate groups is needed to connect different instruments to a universal scale. The technique is especially helpful in the that abilities differ across cohorts. If the cohort abilities are relatively uniform (for example as a result of experimental design) and if the risk of misspecification of the equate groups is high, a good alternative is to rely on the equality of ability distribution. In our application, this was not an option due to the substantial age variation between cohorts. "],
["section-sec-statisticalframe.html", "4.4 Statistical framework", " 4.4 Statistical framework The preferred measurement model for development data is the Rasch model. An introduction of the Rasch model geared towards the \\(D\\)-score is described in https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1/. The Rasch model, models the probability of passing an item as a logistic function of the difference between each person’s ability and the difficulty of the item, see equation (4.1). \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi_{ni} = \\frac{exp(\\beta_n - \\delta_i)}{1+exp(\\beta_n -\\delta_i)} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] The symbols used in equation (4.1) are explained in Table 4.1. The log odds that a person with ability \\(\\beta_n\\) answers an item with difficulty \\(\\delta_i\\) correctly is the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty \\((\\beta_n-\\delta_i)\\) (Wright and Masters 1982). In order to facilitate the use of equate groups to link similar items used in different instruments and cohorts, the Rasch model can be extended. This extension holds the restriction that item difficulties of similar items are constrained as equal. Wright and Masters (Wright and Masters 1982) present a simple method to equate the difficulty between two test forms that have common item links. This is done by estimating the shift in difficulty as the weighted average of difficulty differences of the linked items, and using this weighted average to align the difficulties of the test forms. We can use this way of aligning forms, to align item difficulties of items in an equate group, see equation (4.2). \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta_q = \\frac{\\sum_{l}^{i} \\delta_iw_i}{\\sum_{l}^{l} w_i} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Table 4.1: Overview the symbols used in equations (4.1) and (4.2).

In Figure 4.2 the \\(D\\)-scores are displayed for three cohorts from the GCDG study: Netherlands 1 (GCDG-NLS-SMOCC), Ethiopia (GCDG-ETH) and Colombia 2 (GCDG-COL-LT42M). As decribed in section 2.2, the Netherlands 1 study contains the ddi; Ethiopia the by3; and Colombia the by3, den, asq and bdi. Accordingly there is some natural ovelap in items between Ethiopia and Colombia via the by3 items. However, the Netherlands 1 cohorts is not linked via the items. In the upper plot, no equate groups were used in the model and in the lower plot, equate groups linked the cohorts. Figure 4.2: Example of three cohorts with and without equage group linking. In the plot for the model without equate groups it can be observed that the scales for the Ethiopia and Colombia 2 studies are linked naturally via the shared items from by3. The Netherlands 1 cohort is not connected and follows a different track. In the plot for the model with equate groups, the scales for all three cohorts are connected. This example shows that the use of equate groups brings the abilities for children in different cohorts measured with different instrument on one scale. "],
["section-sec-equatefit.html", "4.6 Quantifying equate fit", " 4.6 Quantifying equate fit In the Rasch philosophy it is the task of the data to fit the Rasch model. In order to verify the fit of the data to the model, we can assess the item fit and the person fit. Both fit measures are explained thorougly in https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1/ch-evaluation.html. When we use equate groups in the Rasch model, we can also use these fit indices to determine the fit of the items in the equate groups. 4.6.1 Well fitting equate groups The evaluation of equate fit involves comparing the observed probabilities of endorsing the items in the equate group to the estimated probability of endorsing the items in the equate group. In an equate group there is an empirical curve for each item in the equate group and one shared estimated curve. The empirical curves should all be close to the estimiated curve for a good equate fit, as presented in the two examples in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Two equate groups that present a good equate fit. The equate Turns head to sound of bell is asked in slightly different formats in the Bayley I (by1), Dutch Development Instrument (ddi) and the Denver (den). The three items are combined in an equate group and the empirical data are clored differently for each instrument in Figure 4.3. Equate Walks alone is administered in six different instruments (bar, by1, by2, by3, ddi and gri). For both equate groups, the empirical data for each instrument is close to the fitted dashed line, which indicates a good equate fit. The infit and outfit indices, shown in Figure4.3, confirm the good fit (fit &lt; 1). 4.6.2 Equate groups with poor equate fit In modeling with equate groups, selecting the perfect combination of equate groups is a crucial step. Poor fitting equate groups need to be set as passive equate groups, such that the items in the group are not restricted to the same difficulty anymore. In a poor fitting equate group the empirical curve for each item in the equate group are not close to the shared estimated curve. Additionally, the fit indices show poor fit as well (fit &gt; 1). Two examples of poor equate fit are shown in Figure 4.4. Figure 4.4: Two equate groups that present a poor equate fit. The equate Bangs in play / Bangs 2 blocks is asked in two different instruments, the Bayley I (by1) and the Denver (den). The empricial curve for the Bayley I item is not close to the fitted curve. The fitted curve is closer to the Denver item, which suggests that the equate difficulty is mostly based on the Denver item data. The fit indices are both larger than 1 also indicating the poor fit. The equate Jabbers expressively is asked in different forms in three instruments (i.e. by1, ddi, and gri). The empirical curves, with different colors for ech instrument, are not close to each other, nor close to the fitted curve. Also for this equate the fit indices confirm the poor fit (fit &gt; 1). Both equates should be deactivated in an updated model. "],
["section-sec-equatedif.html", "4.7 Differential item functioning", " 4.7 Differential item functioning An important assumption for equate groups is that the items in the group work in the same way across the different cohorts, i.e., there is no differential item functioning. This means that the items in the equate group are equally difficult for children in different cohorts. This assumption is critical for active equate groups. If it is not met, restricting the difficulty parameters as equal across cohorts may introduce unwanted bias in comparisons between cohorts. 4.7.1 Good equate group without DIF In Figure 4.5, two active equate groups are displayed with empirical curves in different colors for each cohort. In both equate groups the curves are close to each other and to the fitted dashed curve. The lack of difference between the curves for the differnt cohorts, shows that there is no different equate functioning (i.e. different item functioning, DIF) between the cohorts. Figure 4.5: Two equate groups that present no differential item functioning between cohorts. 4.7.2 Poor equate groups with DIF for study In Figure 4.6, two passive equate groups are displayed, that show differential item functioning between cohorts. The empirical curves are displayed for each cohort separately in different colors. The difference between these curves shows the differential item functioning. For example, the item Throws ball, is easier for children in the South-Africa cohort (purple curve; GCDG-ZAF), and more difficult for children in Colombia (blue curve; GCDG-COL-LT42M). In other words, the probability to pass the item given the D-score (i.e. item difficulty) differs between the cohorts. The same goes for the item Says more than 5 words, which is easier for childen in Jamaica (yellow and pink curves; GCDG-JAM-LBW and GCDG-JAM-SUNTED) and more difficult for children in Ecuador (green; GCDG-ECU).

["section-sec-sem.html", "6.2 Impact of measurement error", " 6.2 Impact of measurement error For each estimated \\(D\\)-score from the calibrated model, the precision of the estimate can be determined. This precision can be expressed as the standard error of measurement (\\(sem\\)). The standard error of measurement is inversely related to the number of items. Thus, when more items are administered for a person, the measurement error for the \\(D\\)-score of this person will be smaller. As is shown in figure 6.1, the sem drops fast when the number of items is increased to 15, and still some more until the number of items is 30. More than 30 items has little effect on the sem. Figure 6.1: Standard error of measurement when the number of items increases. The precision of the \\(D\\)-score estimate is also affected by the information in the items that are administered. This is partly the number of items, as depicted in 6.1, but also if the items are informative for the \\(D\\)-score. For example, if the items are too easy and the probability to pass the item given the \\(D\\)-score is \\(P\\) &gt; 0.90, the \\(sem\\) is larger than when the difficulty of the administered items is closer to the \\(D\\)-score (i.e. \\(P\\) = 0.50). The sem for age in GCDG data shows that for some ages, the sem is larger than for others (see Figure 6.2). This is on the one hand due to the number of items available in that age range, but also to the design of the cohorts where sometimes relatively easy items are administered. Figure 6.2: Standard error of measurement in each age group. In Figure (@refStandard Error of Measurment for age by cohort), the \\(sem\\) per age group is shown for each cohort seperately. This illustrates the differences in design between the cohorts. For example, the Netherlands 1 cohort (GCDG-NLD-SMOCC), the ddi was used as a screener and items had the probability to pass of approximately \\(P\\)=0.80 (quartile range between 0.62 &lt; \\(P\\) &gt; 1.00), and the number of items administered per measurement is about 10 items (quartile range 6 to 12 items). The Colombia 1 cohort (GCDG-COL-LT45M) was an impact evaluation and has administered the by3 where each child answered on average 45 items (quartile range 38 to 57 items) and the probablity to pass was approximately \\(P\\) = 0.64 (quartile range betweeen 0.53 &lt; \\(P\\) &gt; 0.79). The latter study has therefore more precise \\(D\\)-score estimates. The \\(sem\\) for an entire cohort or sample can be obtained by pooling the individual \\(sem_i\\) using general rule for pooling variances. Accordingly, the \\(sem\\) for a sample is obtained by combining the within variance \\(\\sum{sem_{i}^2}\\) and the between variance \\(\\sigma_d\\) as in equation (6.1) \\[\\begin{equation} sem = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{sem_{i}^2} + \\sigma_d }{N-1}} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] In Figure 6.3 the sample \\(sem\\) per cohort are displayed. The lowest sample \\(sem\\) is found in the Ethiopia study (GCDG-ETH) and the highest in the South Africa cohort (GCDG-ZAF). This can be explained on the one hand by the number of items per child, and on the other hand the difficulty of the administered items. Table 6.1 shows the quartile ranges for the number of items per child (n) and the probability to pass the items (p). In The Ethiopia cohort 39 items (Q2; median) were administered with a median probability of 0.66 and in the South Africa study just 12 items with a median probability of 1. Accordingly, in the Ethiopia study more items were administered per child that also have a high level of information for the \\(D\\)-score. In the South Africa study only few items were administered per child that were also relatively easy and therefore contained less information for the \\(D\\)-score.

["section-definition-developmentally-on-track-secreferences.html", "7.2 Definition developmentally on track (#sec:references)", " 7.2 Definition developmentally on track (#sec:references) For child growth, (global) standards are published by the World Health Orgnaization (WHO) that are used to monitor growth in childen and to define whether children are on track. Growth standards are defined for weight-for-age, length/height-for age, weight-for-length/height, etc. In 2006, the methods for constructing a growth reference were reviewed by statisticians and growth experts that resulted in an advised strategy for constructing growth standard (Borghi et al. 2006). A similar strategy can be used to construct a reference standard child develpment-for-age. This reference standard can then be used to determine whether children are developmentally on track. In Figure @ref\\(D\\)-score reference contruction and translation to on-track development., the strategy for constructing standards for development and to use them to define on track dvelopment is explained in several steps. In the first step the D-score is plotted by age and in the subsequent steps, this relation is modelled in an an LMS model. The goal of an LMS model is to describe the relation of the \\(D\\)-score by age with age-conditional z-scores. This is done by three smoothed curves representing the median, coefficient of variation and the skewness. The resulting age standardized scores for development (daz), are then used to define on-track development. So D-scores within 2 standard deviations from the mean can be defines as on-track. Scores that are outside this range, are off-track. Note that the current reference is based on the GCDG study. The cohorts that are currently included are representing a wide range of countries. However, they are not representative for a global population. The current reference standards are therefore temporary and should be improved when more data are available. "],
