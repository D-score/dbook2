["index.html", "D-score for international comparisons Welcome", " D-score for international comparisons Editor: Stef van Buuren (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research TNO, Leiden) Welcome The \\(D\\)-score is a one-number summary that quantifies generic development of children. Here you find introductory booklets on the \\(D\\)-score, each of which addresses a particular aspect of the general idea. The \\(D\\)-score booklet series consists of the following titles: Introduction to the \\(D\\)-score International comparisons Creating better instruments Booklet I is currently available as complete draft. Booklets 2 and 3 are planned for 2019 and 2020. This work is kindly supported by the knowledge integration (ki) program of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know. "],
