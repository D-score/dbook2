The D-score is a one-number summary that quantifies generic neurocognitive development for children with ages 0-4 years. This is the second in a series of three booklets. The series consists of the following titles: D-score for measuring neurocognitive development 0-4 years D-score for international comparisons (this booklet) D-score for creating better instruments The development of this series is kindly supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
