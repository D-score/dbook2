["section-ch-data.html", "Chapter 2 Data", " Chapter 2 Data Booklet I D-score: Turning milestones into measurement highlighted the concepts and tools needed to obtain a quantitative score from milestones from an instrument. Once we have such a score, we may Compare development within the same child over time; Compare development of two children of the same age; Compare development of two children at different ages; Compare development of groups of children at different ages; And so on… In practice, the problem is more complicated. There are about 150 different instruments to measure child development. (Fernald et al. 2017) In principle, one could apply the methodology of booklet I to each instrument separately. Every instrument would thus define its own quantitative scale. The problem with this approach is that measurements made on those scales cannot be compared to each other. More in particular, scores will be specific to the milestones, study samples, and the domain coverage of the particular instrument. In sum, we wouldn’t be able to compare development across instruments, a major impediment. What is needed instead is either Everybody uses the same instrument; We extract comparable scores from different instruments. Option 1 seems easy, but may effectively halt the science of measuring child development. Until we have the perfect instrument option 2 is the only realistic choice. In this booklet we aim to exploit the overlap between instruments to create comparable scores. For example, most instruments have milestones like Can stack two blocks, Is able to stand or Says baba. By carefully mapping out the similarities between instruments we are able constrain the statistical model in a sensible way. As a result, we can map different instruments onto the same scale. This chapter introduces the data that we use to illustrate our methodology. The data originates from a study by the Global Child Development Group (GCDG) gathering child development data from 16 cohorts.

On both occasions the Battelle Development Inventory (bat) was administered (Moura et al. 2010). The Chile 1 study (GCDG-CHL-1) was an impact evaluation study of 128 children assessed at 6 months, 1732 children at 12 months and 279 at 18 months. The by1 was administered at each wave. Long-term follow-up data were available for the WPPSI at 5-6 years (Lozoff et al. 2003). The Chile 2 study (GCDG-CHL-2) was a birth-cohort of 4869 children who were administered the Battelle Developmental Inventory (bat) at 7-23 months and 9201 children who were administered the Test de Desarrollo Psicomotor (tep) at 24-58 months. For the latter group, follow-up data were available for the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) at 5-6 years (Conteras and González 2015). The China study (GCDG-CHN) was an impact evaluation study that contained 990 children assessed with the by3 at 18 months (Lozoff et al. 2016). The Colombia 1 study (GCDG-COL-LT45M) was an impact evaluation study that comprised two waves, wave 1 contained 704 children at 12-24 months and wave 2 631 children at 24-41 months. The by3 was administered at each wave. Long-term follow-up data were available for PPVT at 4-6 years (Attanasio et al. 2014).

["section-sec-instruments.html", "2.3 Instruments", " 2.3 Instruments The Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development (by1,by2, by3) aim to assess infants and toddlers, aged 1-42 months. The current version is the by3, but in GCDG cohorts earlier version were also used (i.e. by1 and by2) (Bayley 1969)(Bayley 1993)(Bayley 2006). The 326 items of the by3 measure three domains: Cognitive items, Motor items (with fine and gross motor items) and Language items (with expressive and receptive items). The by2 contains 277 items and has two additional subscales: Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior. by1 contains 229 items. The Denver Developmental Screening Test (den) is aimed to identify developmental problems in children up to age six. The 125 dichotomous test items are distributed over the age range from birth to six years. The Denver covers four domains: personal-social, fine motor and adaptive, language, and gross motor. The test items are all directly observed by an examiner and are not dependent on parent report (Frankenburg et al. 1992) (Frankenburg et al. 1990). The Griffiths Mental Development Scales (gri) measure the rate of development in infants and young children in six developmental areas: loco motor, personal-social, hearing and language, eye and hand coordination, performance and practical reasoning (Griffiths 1967). The Battelle Developmental Inventory (bat) measures key developmental skills in children from birth to 7 years, 11 months. The instrument contains 450 items distributed over five domains: adaptive, personal-social, communication, motor, and cognitive (Newborg 2005). The Vineland Social Maturity Scale (vin) is a test to assess social competence. The instrument contains eight subscales that measure communication skills, general self-help ability, locomotion skills, occupation skills, self-direction, self-help eating, self-help dressing and socialization skills (Doll 1953). The Dutch Developmental Instrument (ddi) measures early child development during the ages 0-4 years. The instrument consists of 75 milestone items that are distributed over three domains: fine motor, adaptive, personal and social behavior; communication; and gross motor (Schlesinger-Was 1981). The Barrera Moncada (bar) is a Spanish instrument that measures the growth and psychological development of children (Barrera Moncada 1981). The Test de Desarrollo Psicomotor (tep) is an instrument to evaluate toddlers aged 2 to 5 years on their development. The items are distributed over three sub-tests: 16 items assess coordination; 24 items assess language skills and 12 items assess motor skills (Haeussler and Marchant 1999). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (asq) measures developmental progress in children between 2 months and 5,5 years. The instrument assess development in five areas: personal social, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and communication. The asq contains sets of 30 items in 21 age intervals and is completed by the caregiver (Squires and Bricker 2009). The Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales (sbi) is a cognitive ability and intelligence test to diagnose developmental deficiencies in young children. The items are distributed over five subtests: fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing and working memory (Roid 2003)(Hagen and Stattler 1986). "],

["section-sec-challenge.html", "3.1 Are instruments connected?", " 3.1 Are instruments connected? The ultimate goal is to compare child development across populations and cultures. A complication is that measurements are made by different instruments. To do deal with this issue, we harmonize the data included in the GCDG cohorts. In particular, we process the milestone responses such that the following requirements hold: Every milestone in an instrument has a unique name and a descriptive label; Every milestone occupies one column in the dataset; Item scores are (re)coded as: 1 = PASS; 0 = FAIL; Items not administered or not answered are a missing value; Every row in the dataset corresponds to a unique cohort-child-age combination. Cohorts and milestones need to be connected. There are several ways to connect cohorts: Two cohorts are directly connected if they use the same instrument; Two cohorts are indirectly connected if both connect to a third cohort that connects them. Likewise, instruments can be connected: Two instruments are directly connected if the same cohort measures both; Two instruments are indirectly connected if both connect to a third instrument that connects them.

The linkage table shows that studies from China, Colombia and Ethiopia are directly connected (by by3). Brazil 1 indirectly connects to these studies through den. Some cohorts (e.g., Chile 1 and Ecuador) do not link to any other study. Likewise, we might say that aqi, bat, by3 and den are directly connected. Note that no indirect connections exist to this instrument group. Table 3.1 is a somewhat simplified version of the linkage pattern. As we saw in section 2.2, there are substantial age differences between the cohorts. The linked instrument linkage table shows the counts of the number of registered scores per age group. What appears in Table 3.1 as one test may actually comprise of two disjoint subsets, and hence some cohorts may not be connected after all. Connectedness is a necessary - though not sufficient - requirement for parameter identification. If two cohorts are not connected, we cannot distinguish between the following two alternative explanations: Any differences between studies can be attributed to the ability of the children; Any differences between studies can be attributed to the difficulties of the instruments. The data do not contain the necessary information to discriminate between these two explanations. Since many cohorts in Table 3.1 are unconnected, it seems that we are stuck. The next section suggests a way out of the dilemma. "],
["section-sec-mapping.html", "3.2 Bridging instruments by mapping items", " 3.2 Bridging instruments by mapping items Many instruments for measuring child development have appeared since the works of Shirley (1933) and Gesell (1943). It is no surprise that their contents show substantial overlap. All tools assess events like starting to see, hear, smile, fetch, crawl, walk, speak and think. We will exploit the overlap to bridge different instruments. For example, Table 3.2 displays the labels of milestones from six instruments. All items probe the ability of the child to formulate “sentences” of two words. Table 3.2: Example of similar items from different instruments. Item Label by1mdd136 sentence of 2 words by2mdd114 Uses a two-word utterance ddicmm041 Says sentences with 2 words denlgd019 Combine Words grihsd217 Uses word combinations vinxxc016 use a short sentence The idea is to check whether these milestones measure development in the same way. If this is found to be accurate, then we may formally restrict the difficulty levels of these milestones to be identical. This restriction provides a formal bridge between the instruments. We repeat the process for all groups of similar-looking items. A first step in the bridging process is to group items from different instruments by similarity. As the by3 is relatively long and is the most often used instrument, it provides a convenient starting point. Subject matter experts experienced in child development mapped items from other tools to by3 items. These experts evaluated the similarity of wordings and descriptions in reference manuals. Also, they mapped same-skill items across other instruments into groups if these did not map onto by3 items. We order item mappings into five domains: fine motor (FM), gross motor (GM), cognitive (COG), receptive (REC) and expressive (EXP). Figure 3.1 displays the connections between the instruments via the item groups in each domain, with the Prev and Next buttons you can click through the five domains. The items are displayed as the leafs and are colored by instrument. The blue lines display the links between the items (and instruments).

["section-sec-viewmapping.html", "3.3 Age profile of item mappings", " 3.3 Age profile of item mappings One way to explore the similarity of milestones from different instruments is to plot the probability of passing by age. Figure 3.2 shows two examples.The first graph presents the age curves of a group of four cognitive items that assess the ability to put a cube or block in a cup or box. The milestones are administered in different studies and seem to work similarly. The second plot shows a similar graph for items that assess the ability to build a tower of six cubes or blocks. Also here the milestones have similar age patterns. Figure 3.2: The probability of passing by age in potential bridging items. Figure 3.3 presents two examples of weak item mappings. Notable timing differences exist for the “babbles” and “bangs” milestones, which suggests that we should not take these as bridges. Figure 3.3: Probability to pass items for age in poor bridges. While these plots are suggestive, their interpretation is surprisingly complicated. We may find that age profiles of two milestones A and B administered in samples 1 and 2 respectively are identical if A and B are equally difficult and samples 1 and 2 have the same maturation level; A is more difficult than B and sample 1 is more advanced than 2. Similarly, we may find that the age profile for A is earlier than B if A is easier than B and if samples 1 and 2 have the same level of maturation; A and B are equally difficult and if sample 1 is more advanced than sample 2. Note that the age curves confound difficulty and ability, and hence cannot be used to evaluate the quality of the item map. What we need to do is separate difficulty and ability. For this, we need a formal statistical model. The next chapter introduces the concepts required in such a model. "],

["section-sec-eqdef.html", "4.1 What is an equate group?", " 4.1 What is an equate group? An equate group is a set of two or more milestones that measure the same thing in (perhaps slightly) different ways. Table 3.2 contains an example of an equate group, containing items that measure the ability to form two-word sentences. Also, Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show examples of equate groups. Equate groups vary in quality. We can use high-quality equate groups to link instruments by restricting the difficulty of all milestones in the equate group to be identical. Equate groups thus provide a method for bridging different tools. Figure 4.1: Example of three instruments that are bridged by common items in equate groups. Figure 4.1 displays items from three different instruments with overlapping sets of milestones. The shared items make up equate groups, as displayed by the arrows between them. In the example, all three instruments share one milestone (“walk alone”). The “sitting” and “clap hand” items appear in two tools. So in total, there are three equate groups. "],
["section-sec-concurrent.html", "4.2 Concurrent calibration", " 4.2 Concurrent calibration Patterns as in Figure 4.1 occur if we have multiple forms of the same instrument. Although in theory there might be sequence effects, the usual working assumption is that we may ignore them. Equate groups with truly shared items that work in the same way across samples are of high quality. We may collect the responses on identical items into the same column of the data matrix. As a consequence, usual estimation methods will automatically produce one difficulty estimate for that column. The procedure described above is known as concurrent calibration. See Kim and Cohen (1998) for background. The method simultaneously estimates the item parameters for all instruments. Concurrent calibration is an attractive option for various reasons: It yields a common latent scale across all instruments; It is efficient because it calibrates all items in a single run; It produces more stable estimates for shared items for small samples. However, concurrent calibration depends on a strict distinction between items that are indeed the same across instruments and items that differ. In practice, strict black-white distinctions may not be possible. Items that measure the same skill may have been adapted to suit the format of the instrument (e.g. number of response options, question formulation, and so on). Also, investigators may have altered the item to suit the local language and cultural context. Such changes may or may not affect the measurement properties. The challenge is to find out whether items measure the underlying construct in the same way. In practice, we may need to perform concurrent calibration to multiple - perhaps slightly dissimilar - milestones. When confronted with similar - but not identical - items, our strategy is first to form provisional equate groups. We then explore, test and rearrange these equate groups, in the hope of finding enough high-quality equate groups that will bridge instruments. "],
["section-sec-equaterules.html", "4.3 Strategy to form and test equate groups", " 4.3 Strategy to form and test equate groups An equate group is a collection of items. As a part of concurrent calibration, we may specify that some equate groups are active. The analysis will treat items within such groups as one. The milestones within an active equate group will have the same difficulty estimate. Any remaining equate groups are called passive — the model views milestones within such groups as distinct. The milestones within a passive equate group will have separate difficulty estimates. Active equate groups bridge different instruments. In general, we will set the status of an equate group to active only if we believe that the milestones in that group measure the underlying construct in the same way. Note that this does not necessarily imply that all items need to be identical. In Table 3.2, for example, small differences exist in item formulation. We may nevertheless believe that these are irrelevant and ignore these in practice. Reversely, there is no guarantee that the same milestone will measure child development in the same way in different samples. For example, a milestone like “climb stairs” could be more difficult (and more dangerous) for children who have never seen a staircase. Decisions to activate equate groups should be informed by both subject matter expertise and by the fit to the measurement model. The following steps implement our strategy for forming and enabling equate groups: Content matter experts compare milestones from different instruments and sort similar milestones into equate groups. It may be convenient to select one instrument as a starting point, and map items from others to that (see section 3.2); Visualize age profiles of mapped items (see section 3.3). Verify the plausibility of potential matches through similar age profiles. Break up mappings for which age profiles appear implausible. This step requires both statistical and subject matter expertise; Fit the model to the data using a subset of equate groups as active. Review the quality of the solution and optimize the quality of the links between tools by editing the equate group structure. The technical details of this model are explained in section 4.4. Refit the model until (1) active equate groups link all cohorts and instruments, (2) active equate groups distribute over the full-scale range (rather than being centered at one point); Assess the quality of equate groups by the infit and outfit (see section 4.6). Test performance of the equate groups across subgroups or cohorts by methods designed to detect differential item functioning (see section 4.7). The application of equate groups is needed to connect different instruments to a universal scale. The technique is especially helpful in the situation where abilities differ across cohorts. If the cohort abilities are relatively uniform (for example as a result of experimental design) and if the risk of misspecification of the equate groups is high, a good alternative is to rely on the equality of ability distribution. In our application, this was not an option due to the substantial age variation between cohorts. "],
["section-sec-statisticalframe.html", "4.4 Parameter estimation with equate groups", " 4.4 Parameter estimation with equate groups The Rasch model is the preferred measurement model for child development data. Booklet I: Chapter 4 provides an introduction of the Rasch model geared towards the \\(D\\)-score. The Rasch model expresses the probability of passing an item as a logistic function of the difference between the person ability \\(\\beta_n\\) and the item difficulty \\(\\delta_i\\). Table 4.1 explains the symbols used in equation (4.1). Formula (4.1) defines the model as \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi_{ni} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_n - \\delta_i)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_n -\\delta_i)} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] One way to interpret the formula is as follows. The logarithm of the odds that a person with ability \\(\\beta_n\\) passes an item of difficulty \\(\\delta_i\\) is equal to the difference \\(\\beta_n-\\delta_i\\) (Wright and Masters 1982). See the booklet I: 4.6.1 logistic model for more detail. In model (4.1) every milestone \\(i\\) has one parameter \\(\\delta_i\\). We extend the Rasch model by restricting the \\(\\delta_i\\) of all items within the same equate group to the same value. We thereby effectively say that these items are interchangeable measures of child development. Estimation of the parameter for the equate group is straightforward. Wright and Masters (1982) present a simple method for aligning two test forms with common items. There are three steps: Estimate the separate \\(\\delta_i\\)’s per item; Combine these estimates into \\(\\delta_q\\) by calculating their weighted average; Overwrite each \\(\\delta_i\\) by \\(\\delta_q\\). Suppose that \\(Q\\) is the collection of items in equate group \\(q\\), and that \\(w_i\\) is the number of respondents for item \\(i\\). The parameter estimate \\(\\delta_q\\) for the equate group is \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta_q = \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in Q} \\delta_iw_i}{\\sum_{i\\in Q} w_i}. \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Table 4.1: Overview the symbols used in equations (4.1) and (4.2).

["section-sec-commonscale.html", "4.5 Common latent scale", " 4.5 Common latent scale The end goal for using the equate group method to model development items is to measure development on one common latent scale, the \\(D\\)-score. That way, the measure (i.e. \\(D\\)-score) can be obtained, irrespective of which instrument is used in which population. In Figure 4.2 the \\(D\\)-scores are displayed for three cohorts from the GCDG study: Netherlands 1 (GCDG-NLS-SMOCC), Ethiopia (GCDG-ETH) and Colombia 2 (GCDG-COL-LT42M). As described in section 2.2, the Netherlands 1 study contains the ddi; Ethiopia the by3; and Colombia the by3, den, asq and bdi. Accordingly there is some natural overlap in items between Ethiopia and Colombia via the by3 items. However, the Netherlands 1 cohorts is not linked via the items. In the upper plot, no equate groups were used and in the lower plot, equate groups link the cohorts. Figure 4.2: Example of three cohorts with and without equate group linking. The plot for the model without equate groups shows that the scales for the Ethiopia and Colombia 2 studies are linked naturally via the shared items from by3. The Netherlands 1 cohort is not connected and follows a different track. In the plot for the model with equate groups, the scales for all three cohorts are connected. This example shows that equate groups can bring the abilities for children in different cohorts measured with different instrument onto one scale. "],
["section-sec-equatefit.html", "4.6 Quantifying equate fit", " 4.6 Quantifying equate fit In the Rasch philosophy it is the task of the data to fit the Rasch model. In order to verify the fit of the data to the model, we can assess the item fit and the person fit. Both fit measures are explained thoroughly in Chapter 6 of booklet I. When we use equate groups in the Rasch model, we can also use these fit indices to determine the fit of the items in the equate groups. 4.6.1 Well fitting equate groups The evaluation of equate fit involves comparing the observed probabilities of endorsing the items in the equate group to the estimated probability of endorsing the items in the equate group. In an equate group there is an empirical curve for each item in the equate group and one shared estimated curve. The empirical curves should all be close to the estimated curve for a good equate fit, as presented in the examples in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Two equate groups that present a good equate fit. The equate Turns head to sound of bell is asked in slightly different formats in the Bayley I (by1), Dutch Development Instrument (ddi) and the Denver (den). The three items are combined in an equate group and the empirical data are colored differently for each instrument in the upper plot of Figure 4.3. Equate Walks alone is administered in six different instruments (bar, by1, by2, by3, ddi and gri) and is shown in the lower plot. For both equate groups, the empirical data for each instrument is close to the fitted dashed line, which indicates a good equate fit. The infit and outfit indices, shown in the upper left corners, confirm the good fit (fit &lt; 1). 4.6.2 Equate groups with poor equate fit In modeling with equate groups, selecting the perfect combination of equate groups is a crucial step. Poor fitting equate groups need to be set as passive equate groups, such that the items in the group are not restricted to the same difficulty anymore. In a poor fitting equate group, the empirical curves for each item in the equate group are not close to the shared estimated curve. Additionally, the fit indices show poor fit as well (fit &gt; 1). Two examples of poor equate fit are shown in Figure 4.4. Figure 4.4: Two equate groups that present a poor equate fit. The equate Bangs in play / Bangs 2 blocks is asked in two different instruments, the Bayley I (by1) and the Denver (den). The empirical curve for the by1 item is not close to the fitted curve. The fitted curve is closer to the den item, which suggests that the equate difficulty is mostly based on the den item data. The fit indices are both larger than 1 also indicating the poor fit. The equate Jabbers expressively is asked in different forms in three instruments (i.e. by1, ddi, and gri). The empirical curves, with different colors for ech instrument, are not close to each other, nor close to the fitted curve. Also for this equate the fit indices confirm the poor fit (fit &gt; 1). Both equates should be deactivated in an updated model. "],
["section-sec-equatedif.html", "4.7 Differential item functioning", " 4.7 Differential item functioning An important assumption for equate groups is that the items in the group work in the same way across the different cohorts, i.e., there is no differential item functioning. This means that the items in the equate group are equally difficult for children in different cohorts. This assumption is critical for active equate groups. If it is not met, restricting the difficulty parameters as equal across cohorts may introduce unwanted bias in comparisons between cohorts. 4.7.1 Good equate group without DIF In Figure 4.5, two active equate groups are displayed with empirical curves in different colors for each cohort. In both equate groups the curves are close to each other and to the fitted dashed curve. The lack of difference between the curves for the different cohorts, shows that there is no different equate functioning (i.e. different item functioning, DIF) between the cohorts. Figure 4.5: Two equate groups that present no differential item functioning between cohorts. 4.7.2 Poor equate groups with DIF for study In Figure 4.6, two passive equate groups are displayed, that show differential item functioning between cohorts. The empirical curves are displayed for each cohort separately in different colors. The difference between these curves shows the differential item functioning. For example, the item Throws ball, is easier for children in the South-Africa cohort (purple curve; GCDG-ZAF), and more difficult for children in Colombia (blue curve; GCDG-COL-LT42M). In other words, the probability to pass the item given the \\(D\\)-score (i.e. item difficulty) differs between the cohorts. The same goes for the item Says more than 5 words, which is easier for children in Jamaica (yellow and pink curves; GCDG-JAM-LBW and GCDG-JAM-SUNTED) and more difficult for children in Ecuador (green; GCDG-ECU).

The group collected item level measurements obatined on 12 instruments for measuring child development across 16 cohorts. We coded every items as 0 (fail), 1 (pass) or missing. The Battelle Developmental Inventory scores items as 0 (fail), 1 or 2, depending on the level of skill demonstrated or time taken to complete the task. We joined categories 1 and 2 of these items. The ASQ items were originally scored as 0 (not yet), 5 (sometimes) and 10 (succeeds). We recoded both 5 and 10 to 1. We concatenated the datasets from these cohort. The resulting data matrix has 71403 rows (child-visit combinations) and 1572 columns (items) collected from 36345 unique children. We removed 233 items that had fewer than 10 observations in a category. The remaining 1339 items were candidates for analysis. The total number of observed scores was equal to about 2.8 million pass/fail responses. While this is a large number of measurements, about 97 percent of the entries in the matrix is missing. Subject matter experts classified items into groups of similar appearing items, thus forming 184 equate groups. Each equate group contains at least two items. "],
["section-modeling-strategies.html", "5.2 Modeling strategies", " 5.2 Modeling strategies The analytic challenge is twofold: to find a subset of items that form a scale; to find a subset of equate groups with items similar enough to bridge instruments. Note that both subsets are related, i.e., changing one affects the other. Thus, we cannot first identify items and then equate groups, or first identify equate groups followed by the items. Rather we need to find the two subsets in an iterative fashion, primarily by hand. This chapter described some of the modelling issues the analyst need to confront. In general, we look for a final model that preserves the items that best fit the Rasch model; uses active equate groups with items that behave the same across many cohorts and instruments; displays reasonable age-conditional distributions of the D-scores under the model; has difficulty estimates that are similar to previous estimates. The modeling strategy is a delicate balancing act to achieve all of the above objective. Particular actions that we could take to improve a given model are: remove bad items; inactivate bad equate groups; break up bad equate groups; move items from one equate group to another; create new equate groups; remove entire instruments; remove persons; remove studies. In order to steer our actions, we look at the following diagnostics (in order of importance): quality of equate group (both visually and through infit); plausibility of the distribution of the D-score by age per study; correspondence of difficulty estimates from published (single study) Dutch data and the new model; infit of the items remaining in the model. Various routes are possible, and may result different final models. The strategy adopted here is to thicken active equate groups by covering as many studies as possible, in the hope of minimizing the number of active equates needed. "],

The number of equate groups has a substantial effect on the D-score distribution. Use the arrows to see other cohorts. Click ZOOM to enlarge the display. Figure 5.1 is a display of the D-score by age for all 16 cohorts under four models. As a rough reference to compare, the gray curves in the back represent the Dutch model as calculate from the SMOCC study. In order to speed up calculation, the figure shows a random subsample of 25% of all points. Manipulate the plot controls to switch cohorts. All models contain 1339 items, but differ in the number of active equate groups. The most salient features per model are: 1339_0: No equate groups, so different instruments in different cohorts are fitted independently; 1339_11: Connects all cohorts through one or more equated items using 11 equate groups in total; 1339_33: There are 33 equate groups that bridge cohort and instruments; 1339_184: Maximally connects instruments and cohort by all equate groups. Comparison of the D-score distibution by age across these models yields various insights: The locations of cohorts on the vertical scale depends on the number of active equate groups. For example, for Madagascar (MDG) the points are located around 52 when no equate groups are actived, whereas if all are activated it about 68. The age trend depends on the number of active equate groups. For example, for Colombia (COL) or Ethiopia (ETH), the model without equate groups has a shallow age trend, whereas it is steep for the 1339_184 model. The vertical spread depends on the number of equate groups. For example, the spread in the Chile-2 (CHL-2) cohort substantially increases with the number of active equates. Model 1339_0 for the Dutch NLD-SMOCC cohort is equivalent to the model fitted to the SMOCC study alone. Introducing equate groups compresses the range of scores, especially at the higher end. We have no seen that the number of active equate groups has a large effect on the model. The next sections looks into the equate groups in more detail. "],

ZOOM Figure 5.2 displays the percentage of children that pass milestones at various ages. Subject matter experts clustered similar items stemming from different instruments into equate groups. There are 184 equate groups that contain two or more milestones. Most age profiles show a rising pattern, as expected, though some (e.g. FM17 or ). Equate EXP26 combines two-word sentences items from seven instruments into one plot. The item difficulties expressed as age-equivalents (c.f. Section 3.1.2, booklet I) for these cohorts vary between 20-25 months. By comparison, equate group EXP18 (jabber expressively) shows more heterogeneity across cohorts, and is therefore less likely to be useful for equating. Equate group is FM31 (stack two blocks) is another example of a promising example. By comparison, FM38 shows additional heterogeneity. As a last example, consider GM42 (walks alone), which has a similar age profiles across cohorts, whereas GM44 (throws ball) or GM49 (walk down stairs) are more heterogeneous. We could follow different strategies in selecting which eqeate group to active. One strategy would be to include as many equate groups as possible (e.g. all 184 equates) so as to build as many bridges as pososble between different instruments. A more selective strategy would be to activate a subset of promising equates and leave others inactive. The following section compares four different approaches. "],

ZOOM Figure 5.3 shows how the passing percentage depends on the child’s D-score as calculated under four models. All models include the same 1339 milestones, but differ in the number of active equates. The grey curve corresponds to the estimate made under assumption of that milestones are equally difficult. Good milestones for bridging instruments will have a tight bundle of curves. For example, equate EXP26 has tight bundles especially in models 1339_11 and 1339_33. By comparison, the curves of the two extreme models vary considerably: the model without any bridge (1339_0) or the model with all bridges (1339_184) are thus less than ideal. The shallow grey curve of model 1339_184 indicates a poorer overall fit. Outfit and infit statistics measure the residual deviation of the items to the grey curve. High values (e.g. above 1.4) are undesirable, and indicate lack of fit to the model. For example, the values for model 1339_184 (1.70 and 1.25) indicate a mediocre fit, whereas models 1339_33 and 1339_11 fit well. Sometimes the individual item curves are steeper than the grey curve. This indicates that these milestones are more discriminative than the combined item. Model 1339_0 lacks a grey curve and has no fit statistics because that model does not form the combined item. The probability curves provide a quick visual method for spotting promising and problematic equate groups. Examples of promising equate groups include COG36, FM31, GM26 and GM42. A little more weaker are FM26 (has more variability), FM52 (looks promising, but has a problem with the item grigcd402 from the GCDG_JAM_STUNTED cohort), and GM35 (does not align cohort GCDG-ZAF). In such cases, one may wish to move an item out of an equate group, combine equate groups, or inactivate troublesome links. Until now we only looked at models that include all 1339 items. In practice, we may improve upon the model by selecting that subset of milestones that fit the Rasch model. The next section looks in this modelling step in more detail. "],

About 8 percent of the points falls outside the plot. Item infit and outfit are convenient statistics for selecting the milestones that fit the model better. Figure 5.4 displays the infit and outfit statistics of model 1339_11. The correlation between infit and outfit is high (\\(r = 0.84\\)). The expected value of the infit and outfit statistics when the model fits is 1.0. The center of infit and outfit in Figure 5.4 is approximately 1.0, so on average one could say the items fit the model. Note however that fit values above and below the values of 1.0 are qualitively different. Item with fit statistics exceeding 1.0 fit the model less well than expected (underfit), whereas items with fit statistics lower than 1.0 fit the model better than expected (overfit). See Booklet 1: Section 6.1 for more details. Some practitioners remove both underfitting and overfitting items. However, we like to preserve overfitting items and be more strict in removing items that underfit. The idea is that preservation of the best fitting items may increase scale length, and hence reliability and measurement precision. Figure 5.4 draws two cut-off lines at 1.0. Taking items with infit &lt; 1.0 and outfit &lt; 1.0 will select 631 out of 1339 items for further modelling. A practical problem of item removal is that it also affects equate group composition. By default, a removed item will also be removed from the equate group, so item removal may reduce the size of an equate group below two items. For passive equates this is no problem, since passive equates have no effect on the estimates. However, removal of an underfitting item from an active equate group will break the bridge between the instrument it pertains to and the rest of the item set. Potentially this can result in substantial effects on the D-score distribution of the cohort, as demonstrated in Figure 5.1. As a solution, we force any items that are members of active equate groups to remain in the analyis. If that leads to substantially worse equate fit in the next model, we must search for alternative equate groups that bridge the same instruments and that are less sensitive to misfit. "],

So, depending on the person that fills in the item (i.e. the persons ability level), the item provides a certain amount of information to that persons final \\(D\\)-score. The item information can be calculated as the conditional probability to endorse an item (\\(P(\\hat\\delta_i)\\)) times the conditional probability to fail an item (\\(1-P(\\hat\\delta_i)\\)). Accordingly, the maximum information an item can provide is when the probability to endorse an item is equal to the probability to fail, i.e. when \\(P(\\hat\\delta_i) = 0.5\\). The information is inversely related to the error of measurement, thus more information amouts to less error of measurement. For each item score in the data, we can compute the amount of information it contributed to the model \\(D\\)-score. By summing this information for each item in the model, we can obtain a measure of certainty about the difficulty estimate of the item. This sum of information holds the number of times the item was administered, and the probability of endorsing the item for each assessment. We can grade the items by the information into categories A (best) to D (worst) and visualize how certain we are about the difficulty estimates of the items. In Figure 5.5, the grades are displayed for each item by their difficulty (tau). Most items are graded higher than C, 30 items have an information grade of D and may benefit from more data from future studies. The equate groups are displayed as black asterisk and mostly have grade A.

This precision can be expressed as the standard error of measurement (\\(sem\\)). The standard error of measurement is inversely related to the number of items. Thus, when more items are administered for a person, the measurement error for the \\(D\\)-score of this person will be smaller. As is shown in Figure 6.1, the sem drops fast when the number of items is increased to 15, and still some more until the number of items is 30. More than 30 items has little effect on the sem. Figure 6.1: Standard error of measurement (\\(sem\\)) when the number of items increase. The precision of the \\(D\\)-score estimate is also affected by the information in the items that are administered. This is partly the number of items, as depicted in 6.1, but also if the items are informative for the \\(D\\)-score. For example, if the items are too easy and the probability to pass the item given the \\(D\\)-score is \\(P\\) &gt; 0.90, the \\(sem\\) is larger than when the difficulty of the administered items is closer to the \\(D\\)-score (i.e. \\(P\\) = 0.50). The \\(sem\\) for age in GCDG data (see Figure 6.2) shows that for some ages, the \\(sem\\) is larger than for others. This is on the one hand due to the number of items available in that age range, but also to the design of the cohorts where sometimes relatively easy items are administered. Figure 6.2: Standard error of measurement (\\(sem\\)) in each age group. In Figure 6.3, the \\(sem\\) per age group is shown for each cohort separately. This illustrates the differences in design between the cohorts. For example, the Netherlands 1 cohort (GCDG-NLD-SMOCC), the ddi was used as a screener and items had the probability to pass of approximately \\(P\\)=0.80 (quartile range between 0.62 &lt; \\(P\\) &gt; 1.00), and the number of items administered per measurement is about 10 items (quartile range 6 to 12 items). The Colombia 1 cohort (GCDG-COL-LT45M) was an impact evaluation and has administered the by3 where each child answered on average 45 items (quartile range 38 to 57 items) and the probability to pass was approximately \\(P\\) = 0.64 (quartile range between 0.53 &lt; \\(P\\) &gt; 0.79). The latter study has therefore more precise \\(D\\)-score estimates. Figure 6.3: The standard error of measurement (\\(sem\\)) around the age-standardized \\(D\\)-scores (DAZ) per cohort The \\(sem\\) for an entire cohort or sample can be obtained by pooling the individual \\(sem_i\\) using general rule for pooling variances. Accordingly, the \\(sem\\) for a sample is obtained by combining the within variance \\(\\sum{sem_{i}^2}\\) and the between variance \\(\\sigma_d\\) as in equation (6.1) \\[\\begin{equation} sem = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{sem_{i}^2} + \\sigma_d }{N-1}} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] In Figure 6.4 the sample \\(sem\\) per cohort is displayed. The lowest sample \\(sem\\) is found in the Ethiopia study (GCDG-ETH) and the highest in the South Africa cohort (GCDG-ZAF). This can be explained on the one hand by the number of items per child, and on the other hand the difficulty of the administered items. Figure 6.4: Standard Error of Measurement (\\(sem\\)) per cohort. Table 6.1 shows the median number of items per child (test length) and the probability to pass the items (p). In The Ethiopia cohort 39 items were administered with a median probability of 0.66 and in the South Africa study just 12 items with a median probability of 1. Accordingly, in the Ethiopia study more items were administered per child that also have a high level of information for the \\(D\\)-scores. In the South Africa study only few items were administered per child that were also relatively easy and therefore contained less information for the \\(D\\)-scores.

["section-sec-references.html", "7.2 Definition developmentally on track", " 7.2 Definition developmentally on track For child growth, (global) standards are published by the World Health Organization (WHO) that are used to monitor growth in children and to define whether children are on track. Growth standards are defined for weight-for-age, length/height-for age, weight-for-length/height, etc. In 2006, the methods for constructing a growth reference were reviewed by statisticians and growth experts that resulted in an advised strategy for constructing growth standard (Borghi et al. 2006). A similar strategy can be used to construct a reference standard child development-for-age. This reference standard can then be used to determine whether children are developmentally on track. In Figure 7.2, the strategy for constructing standards for development and to use them to define on track development is explained in several steps. By clicking ‘Next’, the next step will show in the plot. In the first step the \\(D\\)-score is plotted by age and in the subsequent steps, this relation is modeled in an LMS model. The goal of an LMS model is to describe the relation of the \\(D\\)-score by age with age-conditional z-scores. This is done by three smoothed curves representing the median (step 2), coefficient of variation and the skewness. In step 3 the centile lines for this model are presented. The resulting age-standardized scores for development (DAZ), are plotted in step 4 to 6. The DAZ is used to define on-track development. So \\(D\\)-scores within 2 standard deviations from the median can be defined as on-track. Scores that are more than two standard deviation below the median, can be defined as off-track (red dots in step 6).

In this paragraph we mainly focus on stunting, which is commonly used to express impaired growth in children due to nutrition problems. 7.4.1 Stunting The WHO defines stunted as when the height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standard median. In Figure 7.3 we compare the percentage stunted to the percentage off-track development in each country. The percentages of stunting differ a lot from the off-track developmental percentages. This indicates that “growth” and “development” are very different construct.

There are several methodologies available to define on-track development. It is possible to define on-track development based on expert opinion, where many experts are consulted to formulate a definition based on their experience and subject matter knowledge. Another option is to define on-track development based on (representative) population data. The methodological process to develop such a reference is visualized in Figure 7.2 in section 7.2. Ideally, the data used to define a reference is representative for the norm population. In this study we do define on-track development as having \\(D\\)-scores within 2 standard deviations from the median, more specifically, \\(D\\)-scores not more than two standard deviation below the median. The \\(D\\)-scores in the green-shaded area in Figure 8.1 are considered as on-track. However, the references used are based on the data from the included cohorts in this study and may not be representative for the global population.

["section-sec-factors.html", "8.2 Types of explanatory factors", " 8.2 Types of explanatory factors There are many known factors that relate to early child development. For example, the educational level of the parents is positively related to development, but also environmental factors such as nutritional status or medical factors such as disease history or birth defects. Unfortunately we do not have all of these factors measured in our data, but for some factors we can describe the frequency distributions for the on-track children versus off-track children. Table 8.1 describes the background characteristics for the children that are on-track versus off-track for development. We can see some differences between the countries and cohorts, but the differences seem small. For mothers education we can see that the higher the educational level, the lower the off-track percentages. And for the residential area we see that the percentage on-track seems higer in the more rural areas.

A measure for early child development that can be interpreted everywhere can either be achieved by having one instrument that is used globally, or by enabling the calculation of a score on a scale that can be obtained from many different instruments. The \\(D\\)-score is the latter, and since the first option would be desirable but at this moment unfeasible, the \\(D\\)-score can in relatively short time give insight in global differences in early child development. As such, the \\(D\\)-score can be used for SDG 4.2.1. However, there are still some limitations, that in time, can be diminished. First, not all instruments that measure early child development are currently included in the \\(D\\)-score key. We are working on expanding the key and additional instruments are added (refer to GSED). Second, the references that can currently be obtained from the \\(D\\)-score that may be used to calculate indices for early child development, are based on the data from different kinds of studies. Since these are not all population studies and some were targeted at specific groups of children, generalization of the scores is not always perfect. So, including more population representative data will improve generalization of the \\(D\\)-score as a global score. Will the addition of new data change the \\(D\\)-score model and metric? It may be possible that the key changes, but we expect that changes are minor. The model that is used now, fits the data well and is developed with great care. "],

In Table … an overview of the items included for each instrument per age is presented. The \\(D\\)-score model enables the possibility to create new instruments that can be customized to the exact needs of the study. Population based studies may require a quick measure by less items and are targeted to a well measured population estimate for development. Whereas intervention studies need a precise estimate for the intervention and control group. At the personal level, studying one child’s development, a more precise estimation may be required. Of each of these scenarios, different instruments can be created. In our third booklet, we will discuss all of these options, and more. "],
