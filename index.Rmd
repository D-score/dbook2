# Welcome {-}

The $D$-score is a one-number summary that quantifies generic
development of children. Here you find introductory booklets on the
$D$-score, each of which addresses a particular aspect of the general
idea.

The $D$-score booklet series consists of the following titles:

1. [$D$-score: Turning milestones into measurements](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/)
2. [$D$-score: Tuning instruments to unity](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook2/)
3. [$D$-score: Tailoring tests to fit the occasion](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook3/)

[Booklet I](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/) is currently
available as complete draft. Booklets 2 and 3 are planned for 2019 and
2020.

This work is kindly supported by the *knowledge integration (ki)*
program of the *Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation*.
