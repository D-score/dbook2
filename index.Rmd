# Preface {-}

This is an introductory booklet on the measurement of child development 
by means of the D-score. The D-score is a one-number summary that 
quantifies generic neurocognitive development for 
children with ages 0-4 years.

This is the *second* in a series of three booklets. The series consists 
of the following titles:

1. [D-score for measuring development of children 0-4 years](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook1/)
2. [D-score for international comparisons](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook2/)
3. [D-score for creating better instruments](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/dbook3/)

The development of this series is kindly supported by the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
