title: "D-score booklet II"
author: "Editor: Iris Eekhout"
description: "The D-score is a one-number summary that quantifies generic development of children, closely modelled after body measurements like height and weight. This booklet describes application of the D-score where different groups are measured by different instruments."

# Tuning instruments to unity {-}

Children learn to walk, speak, and think at an astonishing pace. The D-score captures this process as a one-number summary. The D-score booklets explain why we need the D-score, how we construct it, and how we calculate it. Application of the D-score enables comparisons in child development across populations, groups and individuals.

We are preparing four D-score booklets under the following titles:

I.	[Turning milestones into measurement](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1)
II.	[Tuning instruments to unity](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook2)
III.	[Tailoring tests to fit the occasion](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook3)
IV.	[Taking off the hood](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook4)

Editors: [Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name), [Iris Eekhout](https://www.iriseekhout.com)

[Booklet I](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook1) is currently available as a complete draft. The text of [Booklet II](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dbook2) is almost complete, where much of the text of booklets III and IV still needs to be written. The series addresses conceptual aspects of the D-score, discusses practical issues, and introduces a dedicated set of `R` packages.

The *Health Birth Growth and Development knowledge integration (ki)* program of the *Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation* kindly supports the work.
